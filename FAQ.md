# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why use Tor?

> As many are aware, Tor adds a layer of privacy to your online usage,
Tor also provides an easy, decentralized platform to run applications
with zero configuration (onion site, or HiddenServices).

## Why Bitcoin lightning?

> Much like Tor provides a decentralized platform for hosting our application,
the [lightning network](https://lightning.engineering/) could empower the next
generation in payments by removing credit card payments completely.

## Why Strike.me API?

> Early access to [Strike API](https://developer.strike.me/en/) provided yet
another near zero configuration option, and being the projects goal is
simplicity, this made sense.

## Why Docker

> While [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is not a requirement, it
allows for rapid setup, and demonstration for less tech savvy users. However,
there is nothing stopping you from running the application under a nginx reverse
proxy, and pointing your domain-name at the server.
